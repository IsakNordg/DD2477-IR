	Biological_Systems_Engineering.f
Some references, like math and programs, but nothing of substance
	Candidate_Statements.f
Expected setting, but it has nothing to do with a program in graduate mathematics
	Computer_Science.f
Same as above. Maybe some more references to a program but not in math
	Computer_Science.f
Same as above.
	ECE_Course_Reviews.f
Course evaluations that can be relevant if you're searching for programs, but still only marginally
	Economics.f	# Difficult case
Course evaluations of economic courses.
Can be difficult because it is technically math, but very applied
	Elaine_Kasimatis.f
Description of professor in math. References to the subject
	Evelyn_Silvia.f
Similar to above. Is related to a relevant program
	Events_Calendars.f
Just a bunch of links
	Fiber_and_Polymer_Science.f
Similar to searched query, but not explicitly related to mathematics
	Hydrology.f
Not a related subject, but could be argued to be a 1
	Mathematics.f
Contains descriptions of graduate programs in mathematics
	MattHh.f	# Difficult case
References math program and invites to conversation about math-academics
Difficult because it talks about math but it's not really a source for information.
	Private_Tutoring.f
List of private tutors. Not relevant
	Quantitative_Biology_and_Bioinformatics.f
Not relevant
	Statistics.f	# Difficult case
Highly relevant, but hard to find using a query since it is a program in statistics (but it does not say program in mathematics explicitly)
	Student_Organizations.f
Not relevant
	UCD_Honors_and_Prizes.f
Not relevant
	UC_Davis_English_Department.f
Not relevant to math
	University_Departments.f
Just a list, mentions math but briefly
	What_I_Wish_I_Knew...Before_Coming_to_UC_Davis_Entomology.f
Not related to math
	Wildlife%2C_Fish%2C_and_Conservation_Biology.f
Not relevant, only mentions math
