    ### 2.5.1: Look up the titles of some documents with high rank, and some documents with low rank. Does the ranking make sense?
The documents which have the highest rank seem to be ones of high general relevance to the wiki, since they are about Davis in some way.

The documents with the lowest rank seem to be ones which are just random obscure pages, or ones which are not relevant to Davis at all.

    ### 2.5.2: What is the effect of letting the tf_idf score dominate this ranking? What is the effect of letting the pagerank dominate? What would be a good strategy for selecting an ”optimal” combination? (Remember the quality measures you studied in Task 2.3.)
